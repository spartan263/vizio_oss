controls the access to your terminal by others.  It's typically used to

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fBy\fP
Allow write access to your terminal.
.IP \fBn\fP
Disallow write access to your terminal.
.PP
If no option is given, \fBmesg\fP prints out the current access state of your
terminal.
.PP NOTES
\fBMesg\fP assumes that its standard input is connected to your
terminal. That also means that if you are logged in multiple times,
you can get/set the mesg status of other sessions by using redirection.
For example "mesg n < /dev/pts/46".
