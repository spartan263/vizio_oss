.TH MOUNTPOINT 8 "Mar 15, 2004" "" "Linux System Administrator's Manual"
.SH NAME
mountpoint \- see if a directory is a mountpoint
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /bin/mountpoint
.RB [ \-q ]
.RB [ \-d ]
.I /path/to/directory
.br
.B /bin/mountpoint
.RB \-x
.I /dev/device
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMountpoint\fP checks if the directory is a mountpoint.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-q\fP
Be quiet - don't print anything.
.IP \fB\-d\fP
Print major/minor device number of the filesystem on stdout.
.IP \fB\-x\fP
Print major/minor device number of the blockdevice on stdout.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Zero if the directory is a mountpoint, non-zero if not.
.SH NOTES
Symbolic links are not followed, except when the \fB-x\fP option is
used. To force following symlinks, add a trailing slash to the
path of the directory.
.PP
The name of the command is misleading when the -x option is used,
but the option is useful for comparing if a directory and a device
match up, and there is no other command that can print the info easily.
