1.5.3
-----

Stereo
- Add stereoscopic display support including stereo windows and/or stereo depth.


1.4.14
------

ISaWManManager
- When changing association, reset to default geometry (non-follow) if parent is not found.
- Implement SWMCF_ASSOCIATION and SWMCF_STACKING in SetWindowConfig().

Secure Fusion
- Add SaWManManager flux to implement the public ISaWManManager interface for the application manager
  which could be a slave process without write access to the SaWMan structures. This includes
  QueueUpdate(), ProcessUpdates(), CloseWindow(), InsertWindow(), RemoveWindow(), SwitchFocus(),
  SetScalingMode(), SetWindowConfig(). At the moment all calls are asynchronous because of a very
  difficult to solve issue, that is when an application calls into the master to move a window, the
  master calls into the application manager, but that in turn calls into the master again now. This
  would block as the Fusion Dispatch thread is blocking on the call to the application manager and
  cannot process the call from the application manager.
- Add SaWManProcess flux including SetExiting() and RegisterManager().
- Add permission management to throw functions.
- Add SaWManWindow as an object that can be looked up, thrown, caught...
- Change manager call to use FusionCall v3 copying back and forth the data instead of using
  a shared memory pointer.

Repaint
- Fix crash when multiple regions are repainted due to cursor rendering, thanks to Frank Chou!

Cursor
- Switch between cursor and window context when using hardware cursor.

Debian
- Add package for SaWMan.


1.4.11
------

Module
- Removed lock, using layer context lock instead.

Build
- fixed build with changes in DirectFB's config structure


1.4.10
------

Build
- fixed DIRECTFB_BUILD_PURE_VOODOO checks, thanks to Lionel Landwerlin


1.4.8
-----

API | ISaWMan
- Add GetUpdates() which returns updates done on screen (blocking until updated since last call).

Runtime Options
- Enable support for remote session via Voodoo (when remote option is set).
- Add option "resolution=<width>x<height>" to set a virtual SaWMan resolution, e.g. to be used
  across all input devices (absolute positioning on screen, or unified relative motion/sensitivity).
  Default resolution is either "mode" option from DirectFB if set or queried on first screen.
- Add option "hw-cursor=<layer-id>" to use a hardware layer for the cursor shape.

Implementation
- Implement new cursor APIs of DirectFB.
- Implement sending DWET_UPDATE events.
- Different fixes and minor enhancements.


1.4.5
-----

    sawman: flipping enhancements
    - implements DSFLIP_QUEUE/FLUSH
    - new update scheme for double and triple buffering


1.4.4
-----

    config: update SaWMan help message
    config: fix command line parsing
    testman: call SaWManInit()
    ISaWManManager: layer reconfig -> now also when going from single
    sawman: window composition: alpha blending fix
    sawman: support for DWOP_INPUTONLY
    cursor: fix cursor appearance bug
    flip-once: Implemented configurable timeout via "flip-once-timeout" option.
    flip-once: Added debug messages.


1.4.3
-----

Requires at least DirectFB 1.2.10 or DirectFB 1.4.3.
Only 1.2 and 1.4 branches are supported.

The following features have been added since 1.4.2:

- support for DIEF_REPEAT, so key repeat can be observed
- implement IDirectFBSurface::BeginUpdates() and DSFLIP_ONCE.
- add automatic usage of BatchBlit2 in window composition
- optimized stack updates for premultiplied alpha windows (use copy at bottom)
- several fixes:
    - Added a hack to avoid dead locks: have skirmishes refer to a single lock.
    - key selection: fix for bad flag handling.
    - colorize: now updating properly.
    - keygrabbing: fix for ungrab UNSELECTED KEYS
- files were reorganised to better reflect their contents.
  1.4.2 patches most likely need manual intervention.

1.4.2
-----

Requires at least DirectFB 1.2.9 or DirectFB 1.4.2.
Only 1.2 and 1.4 branches are supported.

The following features have been added since 1.4.1:

- allow the window config value "color" to colorize the window
- add application_id to SaWMan, and app ID changed callback
- fix to make SendWindowEvent() work
- implement missing SWMCF_... in ISaWManManager::SetWindowConfig(),
    except KEY_SELECTION, ASSOCIATION and CWCF_STACKING
